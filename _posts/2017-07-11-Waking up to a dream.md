{: style="text-align: center;"}
I woke up to your dream, like every other day, <br />
feels like drowning in a deep bay 

{: style="text-align: center;"}
Remembering the time we spent together,<br />
those Sea shores and the moonlight were moments like no other

{: style="text-align: center;"}
Remembering your hairs playing with the wind,<br />
those sparkling eyes that kept me pinned

{: style="text-align: center;"}
Magical were the times when we were together<br />
Your words became revelations and I broke the tether

{: style="text-align: center;"}
Even though we live on the same planet<br />
technology could connect us within a nano minute

{: style="text-align: center;"}
But still, the distance looks absurdly wide...<br />
as if there are light years between us to divide

{: style="text-align: center;"}
people said we make a good pair<br />
now I have nothing but despair 

{: style="text-align: center;"}
It feels like, I never dodge the bullet<br />
just lost the love of life

{: style="text-align: center;"}
It was all my fault <br />
and now I self-despise

{: style="text-align: center;"}
I missed the train, now lost in time<br />
not holding you back is my ultimate crime 

{: style="text-align: center;"}
Happiness and sorrow are now all alike<br />
Without you its darkness not a ray of light

{: style="text-align: center;"}
trying to fall asleep like every other day,<br />
your name on lips, remembering our distance in dismay
